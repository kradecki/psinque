  <h3>Back-end and storage technology</h3>
  <p>

We considered multiple providers before we decided to go with Google's App Engine and the Data Store. And yes, we are aware that in light of the most recent NSA related information it might raise some concern on your side. But the truth is, Big Brother most likely already knows everything about you.

  <h3>Security of your personal data</h3>
  <p>
    This is a sensitive topic and it seems that there are three aspects to it

    Protection of your data against govt. agencies
    We cannot guarantee here absolutely anything. Fact is, the moment you start to live online, the data you provide becomes accessible to the government. This is a fact and we cannot do anything to prevent it. Well except going back to rolodex era.

    Protection of your data against being accessed by Google
    Google App Engine is governed by Google's Privacy Policy which states, that google may be using the data to "provide, maintain, protect and improve our services". What we read here is simply "yes, we can".

    Protection of your data against any other third parties
    Psinque promises to keep your data confidential and never share it with third parties. The number of employees that have access to the database engine itself is kept at minimum (currently only 2) and all of them are required to use two-step authentication.
  </p>

  <p>
    Psinque will ask you to provide your full name, nickname, phone numbers, address information, emails, instant messanger data, web sites. Furthermore, psinque will store information that allows to establish a connection between you and your contacts (this is what we refer to as "psinques"). How detailed will be the information you provide us with is left up to you.
  </p>
  <h3>How we will be using your information</h3>
  <p>
    Your information will be used only in accordance with our Terms of Service. In summary, it will be only used to keep the phone books of your contacts up to date. We will not disclose your information to any third party. We may, however, use those data to calculate various statistics.
