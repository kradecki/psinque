  <p>
    A profile should be the very first thing you create when you join Psinque. It is a collection of all your personal data, but don't worry - it is not what others will see. We will come to that part later in the Personas section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Combined with the power and flexibility of Personas, every piece of information you add or modify in the Profile section will be immediately visible to your contacts. Changes to your phone number, last name or address will be automatically and seamlessly propagated to their devices without any extra efort from either side.
  </p>
  <p>
    When creating your profile try to give as much information as you can - trust us, you will profit from that later. Now let's go through all the major elements in your profile page.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Pictures</h3>
  <p>
    The pictures sections can be found on the left hand side of the Profile page. You can upload as much pictures as you want and assign them later to particular personas. Suppoerted formats are JPG, JPEG, PNG and TIFF. To upload a new picture, press the plus sign at the bottom of the section. To remove one, simply press the cross sign to the left of the picture you would like to remove.
  </p>

  <h3>Name</h3>
  <p>
    Except for the two "Romanization" fields, this section is self-explanatory. Romanization if designated for users coming from countries, where non-latin character set is in use (e.g. Japan, India, Korea, China, Russia or Middle East). If you come from such a region, you might still want your foreign contacts to be able to read and search for your name in their phonebooks. If so, use the regular First Name and Last Name fields to write your Name in your native language (Psinque has full Unicode support) and "romanize" it using the respective romanization fields to the right.
  </p>

  <h3>Nickname</h3>
  <p>
    Nickname section is deignated for, well, nicknames. You may include as many nicknames as you wish and assign them later to particular personas. To add a new nickname, type in the desired nickname in the first empty field of the section and click the plus sign on the right hand side. To remove an existing one, press the cross sign to the left of the nickname that you would like to remove.
  </p>

  <h3>Company</h3>
  <p>
    This section is designated for your "business self". In the company field type in the name of your employer (e.g. Psinque) and in the professional title write your currently held position (e.g. CEO). If you work for more than one company, you can always add another entry by clicking the plus sign on the right hand side. To remove an existing entry, simply click the cross sign.
  </p>

  <h3>Birthday</h3>
  <p>
    If you have any questions regarding birthdate, please seek medical advice ;-)
  </p>

  <h3>Primary Email</h3>
  <p>
    The primary email will be used by others to find you. Don't panic! If you haven't created any public persona, the search will only show that an entry matching your email has been found. The serch results will not disclose any personal information.
    If you have a public persona, the search will yield the data you have defined in that persona.
  </p>

  <h3>Additional Emails</h3>
  <p>
    If you have more than one email (e.g. company) save it in the additional emails section. You may create as much additional emails as you'd like.
  </p>
