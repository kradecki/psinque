  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
    Psinque is a young and dynamic team of people commited to one mission - to help you stay in touch with your contacts indefinitely with as little overhead and engagement as possible. We believe that in a world of constant changes, where loyalty has become an outdated concept, everyone deserves to have an island of stability. With our platform we would like to provide you with this island and populate it with your contacts.

  <h3>Our Story</h3>
  <p>
    The idea behind Psinque was born in 2012. Krzysztof, a native Pole living in Germany was forced to purchase a new prepaid Sim Card each time he visited his home country. His friends complained about him having constantly change his numbers and he himself often forgot to inform everyone about the switch. Together with Stanisław they came up with a solution to the problem and started working on back then a no-named tool that evolved into Psinque. Piotr joined the team a few months later to support us in legal matters.
